MLJ OPSC App

Before strarting with the functioning of the application lets run through the innovative 
features that our group has implemented from the part 1 design document. 
The implementation of a firebase realtime database was one of the mentioned features we used
the other feature is automated time tracking.

Start by downloading the applications project file
Make sure you the relevant software to run the application( Android Studio/ BlueStacks)
You can then either run the application through bluestacks with an emulator or
By connecting an android phone to android studio.
After connecting a phone you can then build and run the app
The first page is a login page, current users enter their email and password and click login
New users click register and will be prompted to enter their name, email and password and 
will need to confirm the password then click register
This will take the user back the login page where they can now enter the same email and password
they used to register and then click login.
The next page is the menu, the two buttons available are to add a new project or view existing ones.
Clicking add new project will prompt the user to enter all relevant details about the project. 
This includes the name, category, description, start and end date, the min and max hours for the project
and an image to help uniquely identify the project.
The user then can click add project and it will be saved to the database.
Going back to the menue we can then click on view projects and a list of all the projects for the user will 
be displayed with options to edit/delete the project as well as doing automatic or manual adding of hours.
The view to see total hours will allow you to see the projects total added hours.

This is the basic function of the application.
